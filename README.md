tcpdump auto pcap with attack info this was made by someone called dolphin as of when I got this so all credit too him 

It continuously monitors the network traffic for any unusual activity that could be indicative of a DDoS attack
It will also generate a report of the attack, including the type of attack, the source of the attack, and the duration of the attack.
